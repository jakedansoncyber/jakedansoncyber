#  **Currently Developing**
To learn the whole CI/CD process, I am developing a simple website over at my bulkybook repo that will build, scan, containerize and deploy to AKS. Then I will look to automate that process through ADO & templatize code that will want to be reused by another application.

# **Future Projects**
1. Youtube channel
