# *ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jakedansoncyber* **Iâ€™m currently learning...** 
1. CI/CD & software development lifecycle: ADO Pipelines & Github Actions
    - YAML Pipelines
    - Sonarqube Static Code Scanning
    - Aqua Container Scanning
    - Dependabot Package Scanning
    - Deployments
2. Docker
    - Dockerfile & image building
    - Containerizing applications
    - Lowlevel work such as
        - Docker Daemon
        - Containerd
        - runc
            - Shim
4. Kubernetes
5. Azure
6. Dotnet
    - C#
    - C# MVC Applications
    - C# RESTful APIs

#  **Currently Developing**
To learn the whole CI/CD process, I am developing a simple website over at my bulkybook repo that will build, scan, containerize and deploy to AKS. Then I will look to automate that process through ADO & templatize code that will want to be reused by another application.

# **Future Projects**
1. Youtube channel
