# *ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jakedansoncyber*

# **ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning** 
1. CI/CD & software development lifecycle: ADO Pipelines & Github Actions
2. Docker
3. Kubernetes
4. Azure

#* *Currently Developing**
I am learning the whole CI/CD process. I am developing a simple website over at my bulkybook repo that will build, scan, containerize and deploy to AKS. Then I will look to automate that process through ADO & templatize code that will want to be reused by another application.

# **Future Projects**
1. Youtube channel
